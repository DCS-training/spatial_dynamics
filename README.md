# Spatial dynamics with QGIS and R
This is an advanced course focusing on analysing the first and second-order relationship between observations geospatially. The course will introduce analysis techniques utilising both R studio and QGIS. The session will last appropriately 2 hours covering the following headings,

- Introduction to Point Pattern Analysis
- Density-based vs distance-based analysis (relationship with 1st order and 2nd order dynamics)
- Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
- Nearest Neighbour Analysis (NNA)
- Ripleyâ€™s K-Function

To access the course materials, please download all folders and files from the repository. 

# What you are going to find in this repo
-  .ppt presentations used during the course
-  example code (Spatial Dynamics)
-  gis file (project.qgz)
-  shapefile (Boundary for determining the extent of analysis)
-  shapefile (bike_theft_2023 for performing the analysis)

The csv and the gis_data folder are exercise files that you will need for the exercise. Project.qgz is the file for performing KDE and NNA. To read the shapefiles in Project.qgz, please unzip the zipped folder and keep the name as gis_data, which is the name of the reference folder path in Project.qgz. The SpatialDynamics R file contains the codes for performing Ripley's K-Function. The powerpoint has a summary of the presentation in class and contains descriptions for the fundamentals regarding point pattern analysis and their applications. We hope you will find the course useful.
